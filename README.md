Hey there! This is my personal site, mostly used as a blog. Contributions are welcomed.
## Build Setup
```bash
# install dependencies, prefer npm as yarn and pnpm have issues atm
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000 or whatever port is available
$ npm run dev

# generate static project. note that Netlify can autodeploy to a test branch if it's a PR
$ yarn generate
```
