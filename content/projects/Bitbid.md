A website that tracked the compatibility status of third-party modules for Nuxt 3 during its beta phase.
## The problem
Nuxt 3 beta was released in late 2021. At that time, most modules were incompatible with the new module architecture. Although there was an official page about modules, it didn't show their compatibility with the new version.


[@pi0](https://github.com/nuxt/framework/discussions/751) started a discussion thread with a table showing the compatibility of each module. Someone suggested that it would be cool to create a page for this. I read it over the weekend and thought: _why not?_

## Target Audience
Nuxt.js developers, community members, and module maintainers.

## Visuals

## Goals and Objectives

Create a user-friendly website to track and display the compatibility status of Nuxt 3 third-party modules.
## Design Process
- Conducted research on the compatibility status of various third-party modules.
- Designed a clean and minimalistic UI with an emphasis on readability.
- Implemented the site using Nuxt 3 and TailwindCSS.
- Regularly updated the website with new compatibility information, as well as helping module maintainers.
## Key Features and Functionality

- Responsive and accessible design.
- Clear and concise visual representation of module statuses using cards.
- Filter and search functionality for easy navigation.
- Public API to fetch compatibility info.
- Periodic updates on module compatibility.

## Results and Impact
- Positive reception from the Nuxt core team and community.
- Contributed to the overall progress and adoption of Nuxt 3.
## Lessons Learned and Challenges
- Keeping the website up-to-date with the rapidly changing compatibility landscape.
Designing an intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface to handle a large number of modules.

Some time later, I archived the site in favor of [the official modules](https://nuxt.com/modules) site, as I had the opportunity to integrate some of the features into the official site!
