Antique Radio Shop is an eCommerce website specializing in selling tube radios from the 1950s. The project involved migrating the site from an outdated PHPMyAdmin-based CMS to Nuxt, with a complete rebranding and redesign to enhance performance, accessibility, and SEO.
## The problem

The website hadn't been updated since 2008, resulting in outdated design, poor performance, and low search rankings. The old CMS was difficult to manage and lacked modern features.

## Target audience
- Vintage radio enthusiasts, collectors, and individuals looking for unique home decor items.
- Retail physical stores looking to sell our items
### Goals and requirements
- Use modern and secure technologies to ensure speed, stability, security and integrity.
- Follow e-commerce best practices and improve overall UI/UX

## Process
- Conducted user research and competitive analysis to identify opportunities for improvement.
- Created wireframes and mockups in Figma for the new site design, incorporating modern UI/UX principles.
- Implemented the new design using Nuxt and TailwindCSS, focusing on responsive and accessible design.
- Integrated NetlifyCMS as the new content management system.
- Optimized the site for SEO, including meta tags, schema markup, and content improvements.

- Google Lighthouse 90+ scores in 4 categories (speed, accessibility, best practices, SEO).
- Received compliments from customers on the usability and aesthetics of the new site.
- Reduced architecture costs by switching to JAMstack technologies.
- User engagement: Increased time spent on site by 30% and reduced bounce rate by 25%.
